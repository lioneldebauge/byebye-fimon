Since he loves Github way too much we decided it was the perfect media for his farewell card :wink:
To add your message, just create a new issue and write a few words for Simon! No need to say that any gif, image, video is more than welcome! 

### How to say goodbye ? 

- Click on issues
- Click new issue
- Write the title as if it was a real issue (example: "I will probably never have a funnier boss in my life")
- Write the content content, add any image, link, video, etc. 
- Click Submit new issue, that's it!


We want to see 60+ issues in this repo :rocket:
